  <h2>Come Join Us!</h2>
  <p>If you are looking to be on the game show, either a contestant, coach, or a volunteer, now is the time reach out!</p>
  <p>We have a strict set of rules you <em>must</em> follow:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Each video game genre will be separated into divisions.</li>
  <li>For each division, 14 people will be picked at random to become eSports coaches.</li>
  <li>Each coach must make his or her custom team name and logo Nickelodeon style. Follow the directions given if you're making the team on your own or have one of the artists help you.</li>
  <li>The team name and logo MUST NOT be Nicktoons show specific. Be original.
  <li>The team name and logo CANNOT be inappropriate or rule breaking.</li>
  <li>If you're a coach, will have limited time so we have time to draft teammates.</li>
  <li>Each coach will choose up to a minimum of five Nicktoons characters of their choice for his or her team, alongside five kids after the selected ones get drafted first. That is 10 teammates per team.</li>
  <li>Coaches CANNOT use the same character more than once.</li>
  <li>Another coach CANNOT choose the same character if it has already been drafted.</li>
  <li>Every Nicktoons character has a unique set of personality and skills. So, coaches can be strategic about choosing the characters they desire to draft.</li>
  <li>Each team will have a limited time of training, which will be revealed later. So, each coach's job is to do the following:</li>
  <li>Game Analysis - Study gameplay footage of the game the coaches signed up for to identify the areas for improvement, analyzing strategies, and developing counter-tactics.</li>
  <li>Individual Player Development - Create personalized training plans for each player based on their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
  <li>Team Strategy Development - Design and implement team strategies for different scenarios within the chosen game.</li>
  <li>Mentorship and Communication - Provide feedback and motivation to players, fostering positive team dynamics, and address any issues within the team.</li>
  <li>Scrimmage Management - Arrange and oversee practice matches against other teams to test strategies and assess player performance.</li>
  <li>Stay Updated On Game Patches - Keep up-to-date with game updates and changes to adapt strategies accordingly.</li>
  <li>On the day of the tournament, each team will be assigned to a place on a bracket. The rules will be given specifically for each video game.</li>
  <li>If there is a teammate that will be absent or sick, let the staff know ahead of time, so another participant can fill in for that person.</li>
  <li>Most of all, have fun!</li>
  </ul>
